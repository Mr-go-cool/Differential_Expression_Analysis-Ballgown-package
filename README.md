# Differential_Expression_Analysis-Ballgown-package
This workflow uses the Ballgown package for differential expression analysis at both gene and transcript levels. Unlike traditional methods, Ballgown analyzes RNA-Seq data directly at the transcript level, providing more detailed insights.

#Key features of the Ballgown package:

Gene-level and transcript-level analysis: Ballgown enables differential expression analysis without the need to collapse transcript data into gene-level summaries, preserving the granularity of the data. Flexible and efficient: The package can handle large RNA-Seq datasets and perform statistical tests for differential expression while accounting for different experimental conditions. Visualization: Ballgown offers visualization tools like PCA plots and heatmaps, which help in understanding the overall trends and patterns in the data. Supports multiple types of measurements: It works with various RNA-Seq quantification formats, such as FPKM, TPM, and raw counts, making it adaptable to different analysis setups.

This method facilitates the discovery of differentially expressed genes and transcripts, and can help identify key biological insights in transcriptomic studies. Whether you're studying gene expression in different conditions, or exploring more nuanced transcript-level changes, the Ballgown package is a powerful tool for RNA-Seq analysis.
